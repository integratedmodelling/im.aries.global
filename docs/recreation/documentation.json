It is a symmetric function with constant return to scale (the service increases by that same proportional change as supply and demand change) and diminishing marginal utility. This output facilitates the identification of sites with high recreation supply and demand, where outdoor recreation day trips are most likely to happen. Such areas receive a value closer to one; areas with low supply or demand receive values closer to zero.","sectionType":"BODY","documentedUrns":["aries.global.recreation.recreation-resolver-3"],"variables":{}},"recreation.impedance#Definition#Methods":{"trigger":"DEFINITION","sectionRole":"METHODS","section":"Methods","documentedId":"recreation.impedance","extended":null,"template":"@require(im.aries.global.introduction.recreation, Introduction)\r\n\r\n@section(Outdoor Recreation)\r\n\r\nThe **travel impedance** function describes how far an individual is likely to travel for recreation on a day trip. The mobility function, adapted from Paracchini et al. (2014) @cite(Paracchini2014) and originally based on Geurs and van Eck (2001) @cite(GeursEck2001) models the probability of traveling to a site as a function of distance, assuming high probability of trips within 30 Km and very low probability at 80 Km:\r\n\r\nf(d) = (i + K) / (K + exp(a*d))\r\n\r\nwhere _d_ is the distance from a site and _K_ and _a_ are parameters describing the shape (S-shape) and scale of the log-logistic function (Geurs and van Eck, 2001), respectively. We further customize the original function by adding a dependency on estimated travel time @cite(UchidaNelson2010):\r\n\r\n* _d_ is the distance to main cities; when travel time is >30 min, then d = d + 30 km.
