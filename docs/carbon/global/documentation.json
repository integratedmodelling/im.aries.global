Reusch and Gibbs note several important caveats to their model. For instance, it does not account for forest age or successional stage, aside from noting the presence of frontier forests and burned areas, and may introduce some error  at the edges of continents or ecoregions. Reusch and Gibbs do not provide data on carbon storage in wetlands, which are lumped with forest, shrub, or grassland land cover classes (we include a model of mangrove carbon to address this limitation in mangroves). Despite these issues and the relative age of this method, our updates to the Ruesch and Gibbs model provide a method to roughly quantify changes over time in vegetation carbon storage anywhere in the world. Importantly, it also gives users the option of easily updating all data layers (with newer or local datasets) and carbon storage coefficients, i.e., using IPCC Tier 2 methods.","sectionType":"BODY","documentedUrns":["aries.global.carbon.mass-resolver"],"variables":{}}}
