# Global supply-demand ecosystem service models for ARIES

This project contains the baseline conceptualization of ecosystem services supply 
and demand for the ARIES platform. A set of commonly recognized ecosystem service 
categories is represented in ARIES by a suite of logical statements, data and models 
that are used when not enough information is available to build more detailed, dynamic 
flow models. The models built by ARIES using such statements have, in general, similar 
resolution and conceptual detail as those available in other ES assessment toolkits 
such as InVEST or ESTIMAP. Some of the methods implemented in this project are inspired 
by or derived from others; all sources are credited in the report built during each 
session.

These models are served by the ARIES network and are thus available to any user of 
the ARIES platform, i.e. anyone who is using the k.LAB Explorer or Modeler software 
(locally or online) and has obtained a certificate that includes ARIES. No further 
downloads or installations are required. Details on how to obtain a certificate can 
be found at the [ARIES](http://aries.integratedmodelling.org) or the [Integrated Modelling Partnership](http://www.integratedmodelling.org)} 
web sites.

The models can run everywhere on the globe without user input. Due to the nature 
of the ARIES semantic web platform, ....

# Platform

This project is written in the k.IM semantic modeling language and requires the k.LAB 
software stack version 0.10.0 or higher. Like in all k.LAB applications, each model 
in this project is _logically_ self-contained and can be run in isolation; each is 
expressed in the terms of the [IM worldview]() and must be run within the [k.LAB network]() 
in order to resolve every logical dependency to data or models appropriate for the 
context and scale of interest.

# Documentation

Models written in k.IM are close to the English language and aim to be _naturally_ 
readable. A look at the k.IM files in the src/ directory should provide enough detail 
as is. Documentation templates for each model are also included in this project, 
formatted for the k.LAB documentation engine, so that each run can self-document 
into a detailed human-readable report. 

A scientific article about the models included in this project is in review at the 
time of this writing, and will be linked here as soon as publicly available.

# License

These models, like the entirety of the k.LAB infrastructure that runs them, are open 
source, released under the terms of the Affero General Public License 3.0 or any 
higher version.
