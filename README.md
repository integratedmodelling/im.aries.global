# Global supply-demand ecosystem service models for ARIES

This project contains a baseline conceptualization of ecosystem services (ES) supply 
and demand for the ARIES platform. The logical statements, data and models provided 
here that are used to build observations of commonly recognized ecosystem service 
value metrics when not enough information is available to build more detailed, dynamic 
flow models. The models built by ARIES using such statements have, in general, similar 
resolution and conceptual detail as those available in other ES assessment toolkits 
such as InVEST or ESTIMAP. Some of the methods implemented in this project are inspired 
by or derived from others; all sources are credited in the report built during each 
session.

These models are served by the ARIES network and are thus available to any user of 
the ARIES platform, i.e. anyone who is using the k.LAB Explorer or Modeler software 
(locally or online) and has obtained a certificate that includes ARIES. No further 
downloads or installations are required. Details on how to obtain a certificate can 
be found at the [ARIES](http://aries.integratedmodelling.org) or the [Integrated Modelling Partnership](http://www.integratedmodelling.org)} 
web sites.

The models can run everywhere on the globe without user input. Due to the nature 
of the ARIES semantic web platform, ....

# Contents and use

As released, the project contains fully specified model content concerning the following 
ES problem areas:

* Riverine flood regulation
* Carbon storage
* Outdoors recreation
* Pollination
* Sediment retention

Areas in development for a forthcoming release in the short term include:

* Mariculture suitability
* Water availability

In addition, this project provides a bridge to Multiple Criteria Analysis models 
that allow automated *trade-off analysis* between diverse ES metrics, combined with 
user-specified weights that encode priorities according to the point of view of 
one or more stakeholders.

## Example queries

As ARIES operates on conceptual queries, the model content provided here does not 
implement monolithic "models" of ES, but rather provides the logical and computational 
underpinning to _resolve_ ES-related user queries. These can be entered in the ARIES 
Explorer interface as English sentences as exemplified below, or chosen from a customizable 
palette of concepts of interest. 

Some example queries per each ES category whose value is available globally at regional 
to country scales and with seasonal to annual temporal scale:

* Flood regulation:
- probability of Flood
- Potential value of FloodRegulation
- Demanded value of FloodRegulation
- Net value of FloodRegulation (surplus/deficit)
* Outdoors recreation:
- Realized value of Outdoors Recreation
- Potential value of Outdoors Recreation
- Demanded value of Outdoors Recreation
- value of Outdoors Recreation (production function combining supply and demand)
- Net value of Outdoors Recreation (surplus/deficit)
* Pollination:
- Occurrence of Pollinator Insect caused by Weather
- Occurrence of Pollinator Insect caused by Landscape
- Occurrence of Pollinator Insect
- Net value of Pollination (surplus/deficit)
* Sediment retention:
- Potential Removed Soil Mass [in t/ha or other units]
- Retained Soil Mass caused by Vegetation [as above]

# Platform

This project is written in the k.IM semantic modeling language and requires the k.LAB 
software stack version 0.10.0 or higher. Like in all k.LAB applications, each model 
in this project is _logically_ self-contained and can be run in isolation; each is 
expressed in the terms of the [IM worldview]() and must be run within the [k.LAB network]() 
in order to resolve every logical dependency to data or models appropriate for the 
context and scale of interest.

# Documentation

Models written in k.IM are close to the English language and aim to be _naturally_ 
readable. A look at the k.IM files in the src/ directory should provide enough detail 
as is. Documentation templates for each model are also included in this project, 
formatted for the k.LAB documentation engine, so that each run can self-document 
into a detailed human-readable report. 

A scientific article about the models included in this project is in review at the 
time of this writing, and will be linked here as soon as publicly available.

# License

These models, like the entirety of the k.LAB infrastructure that runs them, are open 
source, released under the terms of the Affero General Public License 3.0 or any 
higher version.

# Contact
